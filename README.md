# My LightOJ Solutions
My LightOJ solutions scraped with scrapy. How this was done is written [here.](https://sjsakib.github.io/2017/scraping-lightoj/)

If you want to use this scraper

1. Install `scrapy` and `bs4`
2. Delete the `codes` folder
3. Delete everything from the `done.json` file
4. Add your userid and password in the `settings.py` file
5. Run the spider
